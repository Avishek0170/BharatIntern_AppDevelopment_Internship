# BharatIntern_AppDevelopment_Internship
As an intern with Bharat Intern, I was selected for App Development. I got three tasks to complete in this internship with guidance with the internship mentors. I came up with the all the tasks for which I created a Calculator Clone App, Temperature Converter Clone App and Quiz Clone App.

I undertook this internship project and completed it under the guidance of Bharat Intern Management. I am grateful to their staff for their patience and assistance during my training. It was a good learning experience for me to work with them. These skills would help me expand my resume and advance my career.
